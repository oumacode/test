# Resources:
This page is dedicated to share some of the resources that helped me to learn what I learned and potential gems to learn about react and others:

## Web development as a field:
[TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is a good place to start.
the course is open source, which means that it get updated with the latest information about the technologies regularly.
The course goes through various topics such as: basic Git & GitHub, advanced HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js and more (You can pick Ruby's path and learn Ruby on Rails instead of focusing on JavaScript only).

[MDN Curriculum](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/) is provides a structured guide to the essential skills and practices for being a successful front-end developer, along with recommended learning resources.
Last updated: February 2024 which means it is new.

[MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) provides some rich documentation about the web technologies.

[MDN AI Help](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/plus/ai-help) A ChatGPT based AI Help which tries to give you an accurate answer using the official MDN docs as a base.

- NOTE: The Odin Project goes through various topics, you can directly search for the topics that interest you if you want to peek at it.(Example: [Setting up Git](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-setting-up-git), [Installing Node.js](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-installing-node-js), [Setting Up A React Environment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-setting-up-a-react-environment) and more)

## Vim:
[ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen) is a great guy and a software engineer, EXFAANG BTW.
He has some high quality videos about [Neo(Vim) as an editor for the Linux users but also about Vim motions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6AR2RMB5tE&list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R) which can be used in almost every IDE known to mankind.
- NOTE: You can ignore the Neovim setup and just learn the motions on it's own.

For more advanced motions, you can watch some random videos about Vim.
- NOTE: Be careful, some tips will work on the Vim editor itself and not on your IDE, you might even have some conflicts between some shortcuts that you need to resolve manually through digging in the settings and the config of your IDE.
## Computer Science as A whole:
[CS50 x 2024 Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T381WAHyx1pq-sBfykqMBI7V4) Is a good playlist to start, from the one and only Harvard university, so you know it good.
